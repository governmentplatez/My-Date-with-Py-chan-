Additional Developer notes that I couldn't mention in the video since it would have exceeded the 3 minute limit: 
   - It did get me back into drawing even so I will probably go back some time later and flesh everything else out :)
   - Designing Py-chan was really hard but also fun. Even if her sprite isn't really a proper sprite I think it was a fun little improvisation
   - Py-chan does in fact live inside the protagonists PC via his IDE (hence why she claims she's from IDE university and just transferred a bit ago because that's when the progtagonist started taking python classes) but is also their OC but she is alive because of the power of love or something like that it's very complicated 
   - I wanted to make it satire of visual novels but it's kind of hard to think of anything outside the meta trope  used in DDLC and You and Me and Her
